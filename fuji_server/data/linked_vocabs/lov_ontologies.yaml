  description: Metadata vocabularies are used in various domains of study. It provides an in-depth description of the resources. In this work, we develop Algorithm Metadata Vocabulary (AMV), a vocabulary for capturing and storing the metadata about the algorithms (a procedure or a set of rules that is followed step-by-step to solve a problem, especially by a computer). The snag faced by the researchers in the current time is the failure of getting relevant results when searching for algorithms in any search engine. AMV is represented as a semantic model and produced OWL file, which can be directly used by anyone interested to create and publish algorithm metadata as a knowledge graph, or to provide metadata service through SPARQL endpoint. To design the vocabulary, we propose a well-defined methodology, which considers real issues faced by the algorithm users and the practitioners. The evaluation shows a promising result.

    The Building Topology Ontology (BOT) is a simple ontology defining the core
    concepts of a building.


    It is a simple, easy to extend ontology for the construction industry to document and exchange building data on the web.


    Changes since version 0.2.0 of the ontology are documented in:

    https://w3id.org/bot/bot.html#changes


    The version 0.2.0 of the ontology is documented in:

    Mads Holten Rasmussen, Pieter Pauwels, Maxime Lefrançois, Georg Ferdinand Schneider, Christian Anker Hviid and Jan Karlshøj (2017) Recent changes in the Building Topology Ontology, 5th Linked Data in Architecture and Construction Workshop (LDAC2017), November 13-15, 2017, Dijon, France, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320631574_Recent_changes_in_the_Building_Topology_Ontology


    The initial version 0.1.0 of the ontology was documented in:

Using this extension, it becomes possible to describe a context for construction-related datasets that are being distributed using Web technology as well as datasets that are not shared outside an organization such as local copies, work in progress and other datasets that remain internal. This dataset metadata encompasses the temporal context (period or snapshot), the type of content of the dataset (as-built, design, etc.) and relations between contextualized datasets (previous as-built, requirements related to a design, etc.). In addition, this DCAT extension also provides terminology for managing dataset distributions that are scoped to a certain (named or default) graph of an RDF file or quadstore.

The model is based on the fundamental 5W1H journalistic questions, that are Who?, What?, When?, Where?, Why? and How?. Another important requirement was the attempt to exploit existing knowledge graphs and ontologies such as the Simple Event Model (SEM) Ontology and the Schema.org data model for interoperability and interconnection.'

    Le projet Advene a pour objectif de fournir un modèle et plusieurs formats

    hypérvidéos générées à partir de ces vidéos et des annotations. Les
    enseignants, les amateurs de cinéma, etc., peuvent les utiliser pour
    échanger leurs commentaires et analyse de documents audiovisuels.


    Le modèle Cinelab permet non seulement de représenter les annotations vidéos, mais aussi d'expliciter leur structure (à travers les notions de schéma et de type d'annotation), ainsi que leur présentations à l'aide de vues (modèles appliqués aux données pour produire des hypervidéos) et de requêtes.


    Ce modèle a été développé par les partenaires du projet Cinelab (2007-2008, financé par l'ANR), et utilisé par la suite dans plusieurs projets et applications, dont Advene (LIRIS) et Ligne de temps (IRI).

  description: "The ontology, presented here in a beta version, is based on the analysis of the documentation and descriptive requirements of the Intesa Sanpaolo Historical Archive and is intended to describe the content of historical banking documents and of some of the activities carried out by the bank, particularly in relation to third parties (loans, charity donations, seizures and confiscations, etc.), which involve the initiation of processes or the production of documents. The focal point of the descriptive model is the bank - an entity that initiates different types of processes, whose common feature is that they are structured into various stages/events - and the relationship between the documentation produced and the information it contains. In fact, this ontology is based on information collected from archived documents which describe various processes and activities carried out by banking institutions: the starting point for its construction were the inventories and databases of documentation stored in the Historical Archive which was produced by the various banks that over time were merged into Intesa Sanpaolo. The ontology was created to provide a sufficiently abstract representation and model for describing the processes of various banking activities from which the documentation was produced - from a company's request for financing and its outcome, to the preparation of seizure, confiscation and asset restitution filings, to charitable contributions, just to mention a few examples - reusing models that were already well established and widely used. The structure of the proposed ontology is in fact intended to adapt to the various activities, described in the archive files that a banking institution performs in relation to third parties. The proposed ontology is therefore not an ontology on banking activity in general, but on the relationship between this activity and the documents that are produced. Moreover, its objective is not to describe the documents in the strict sense of the term, for which reference is made to OAD ontology. The purpose of this project is to lay the initial, and fundamental, building blocks for describing the complexity, variety, and breadth of the domain of archiving bank records and the data they contain. Despite having data from different banks relating to different activities and having already made arrangements for the integration of third-party datasets and ontologies, before completing the project we will have to wait for the processing of representations based on other types of documents and banking institutions, including non-Italian ones."

    The data.gov.au Dataset Ontology is an OWL ontology designed to describe the
    characteristics of datasets published on data.gov.au.


    The ontology contains elements which describe the publication, update, origin, governance, spatial and temporal coverage and other contextual information about the dataset. The ontology also covers aspects of organisational custodianship and governance.

    By using this ontology to describe datasets on data.gov.au publishers increase discoverability and enable the consumption of this information in other applications/systems as Linked Data. It further enables decentralised publishing of catalogs and facilitates federated dataset search across sites, e.g. in datasets that are published by the States.

    Other publishers of Linked Data may make assertions about data published using this ontology, e.g. they may publish information about the use of the dataset in other applications.

    This ontology is a reduced-in-scope version of the [W3C Decisions and

    Group](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/decision/)'s Decision Ontology (DO)
    which can be found at <https://github.com/nicholascar/decision-o>. It has
    been re-worked to align entirely with the W3C's [PROV
    ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) since it is widely recognised that
    analysing the elements of decisions *post hoc* is an exercise in provenance.


    Unlike the original DO, this ontology cannot be used for *normative* scenarios: it is only capable of recording decisions that have already been made (so-called *data-driven* use in the DO). This is because PROV, to which this ontology is completely mapped, does not have a templating system which can indicate what *should* occur in future scenarios.


    This ontology introduces only one new element for decision modelling over that which was present in the DO: an Agent which allows agency in decision making to be recorded.

    The euBusinessGraph (`ebg:`) ontology represents companies,
    type/status/economic classification, addresses, identifiers, company
    officers (e.g., directors and CEOs), and dataset offerings.


    It uses `schema:domainIncludes/rangeIncludes` (which are polymorphic) to describe which properties are applicable to a class,

    rather than `rdfs:domain/range` (which are monomorphic) to prescribe what classes must be applied to each node using a property.

    We find that this enables more flexible reuse and combination of different ontologies.

    We reuse the following ontologies and nomenclatures, and extend them where appropriate with classes and properties:


    - W3C Org, W3C RegOrg (basic company data),


    - W3C Time (officer membership),


    - W3C Locn (addresses),


    - schema.org (domain/rangeIncludes and various properties)


    - DBpedia ontology (jurisdiction)


    - NGEO and Spatial (NUTS administrative divisions)


    - ADMS (identifiers),


    - FOAF, SIOC (blog posts),


    - RAMON, SKOS (NACE economic classifications and various nomenclatures),


    - VOID (dataset descriptions).

    The initiative Aragón Open Data was initiated by agreement of 17 of July of
    2012 of the Government of Aragon. Under the same was ordered the start of
    the project to open public data and on February 6, 2013 was implemented
    through the Portal <a href="http://opendata.aragon.es/"> opendata.aragon.es
    </a>.


    Throughout this time there have been numerous works to achieve automation in the publication of information to ensure that third parties can reuse it in the best way. Given the volume of data that begins to exist, within the line of work of automation in information management, all those elements that help in the improvement of the <b> structuring of information </b>  and the <b> standardization of the data </b> contained in the databases are beginning to have a special relevance.


    Based on this, within the General Directorate of Electronic Administration and Information Society, the idea arises of generating a set of technical and legal rules that allow to deepen in that standardization and that lead to think in the creation of the Interoperable Information Scheme Of Aragon (E2IA). The E2IA thus emerges as the framework in which the open data and in general the information of the Government of Aragon can begin to be automated in a much more profound way. The E2IA has to have a number of technical, organizational and legal elements that need to be developed.


    For this reason, the Technological Institute of Aragon (ITAINNOVA) has been entrusted with carrying out actions consisting in identifying, studying and analyzing current research trends and technological development in relation to ontologies and dictionaries of data interoperability, defining the ontological proposal, performing The necessary tests to validate the ontological proposal and generate the text and web versions of the ontology.

    This is the human and machine readable Vocabulary/Ontology governed by the
    European Union Agency for Railways. It represents the concepts and
    relationships linked to the sectorial legal framework and the use cases
    under the Agency´s remit. Currently, this vocabulary covers the European
    railway infrastructure and the vehicles authorized to operate over it. It is
    a semantic/browsable representation of the
    [RINF](https://www.era.europa.eu/sites/default/files/registers/docs/rinf_application_guide_for_register_en.pdf)
    and
    [ERATV](https://www.era.europa.eu/sites/default/files/registers/docs/iu-eratv_application_guide_for_register_2016-797_en.pdf)
    application guides that were built by domain experts in the RINF and ERATV
    working parties.

    Since version 2.6.0, the ontology includes the routebook concepts described in appendix D2 \"Elements the infrastructure manager has to provide to the railway undertaking for the Route Book\" (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2019/773/oj) and the appendix D3 \"ERTMS trackside engineering information relevant to operation that the infrastructure manager shall provide to the railway undertaking\".

  authority: lov
  description: >-
    The ontology of the taxonomy "European Skills, Competences, qualifications
    and Occupations".


    The ontology considers three ESCO pillars (or taxonomy) and 2 registers.

    The three pillars are:

    - Occupation

    - Skill (and competences)

    - Qualification


    For the construction and use of the ESCO pillars, the following modelling artefacts are used:

    - Facetting support to specialize ESCO pillar concepts based on bussiness relevant Concept Groups (e.g. species, languages, ...)

    - Conept Groups, Thesaurus array and Compound terms (as detailed in ISO 25964) to organize faceted concepts

    - SKOS mapping properties to relate ESCO pillar concepts to concepts in other (external) taxonomies (e.g. FoET, ISCO88 and ISCO08.  More mappings can be added in the future.)

    - Tagging ESCO pillar concepts by other (external) taxonomies (NUTS, EQF, NACE, ...)

    - Capture gender specifics on the labels of the ESCO pillar concepts

    - Rich ESCO concept relationships holding a description and other specific characteristics of the relation between two ESCO pillar concepts.


    ESCO maintains two additional registers:

    - Awarding Body

    - Work Context

    Awarding Bodies typically are referenced by ESCO qualifications.

    Occupations can have one or more work context.

    A feature of interest is an abstraction of a real world phenomena (thing, person, event, etc). A feature of interest is then defined in terms of its properties, which are qualifiable, quantifiable, observable or operable qualities of the feature of interest.


    Alignments to other ontologies are proposed in external documents:


    - [SSNAlignment](https://w3id.org/seas/SSNAlignment) proposes an alignment to the [SSN ontology](http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/).

  description: >-
    The objective of gUFO is to provide a lightweight implementation of the
    Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) [1-5] suitable for Semantic Web OWL 2 DL
    applications.


    Intended users are those implementing UFO-based lightweight ontologies that reuse gUFO by specializing and instantiating its elements.


    There are three implications of the use of the term lightweight. First of all, we have employed little expressive means in an effort to retain computational properties for the resulting OWL ontology. Second, we have selected a subset of UFO-A [1, 2] and UFO-B [3] to include here. In particular, there is minimalistic support for UFO-B (only that which is necessary to establish the participation of objects in events and to capture historical dependence between events). Third, a lightweight ontology, differently from a reference ontology, is designed with the purpose of providing an implementation artifact to structure a knowledge base (or knowledge graph). This has driven a number of pragmatic implementation choices which are discussed in comments annotated to the various elements of this implementation.


    The 'g' in gUFO stands for gentle. At the same time, "gufo" is the Italian word for "owl".

  description: >-
    Metadata4Ing defines classes and properties or reuses such classes and
    properties from other ontologies to describe research processes and research
    data management in NFDI4Ing.

    New concepts and properties are located in the namespace of Metadata4Ing.

    Metadata4Ing does not import complete ontologies for the sake of relevance, readability, understandability and usability by and for engineers.

    Instead, it tries to make re-use of existing identifiers for classes and properties by re-using all or a relevant subset of the axioms from the original ontology.

    These statements have been extracted in different ways, e.g. by using Protégé tools importing an ontology and copying axioms of relevant items to Metadata4Ing or by download from data services or raw files of ontologies and manual copypasting.

    In some cases there was a need to extend or modify the original set of statements about an entity, e.g. because labels and definitions were expressed with a different owl:AnnotationProperty than the rest of Metadata4Ing, or because a skos:preflabel or a skos:definition in any of the languages we would like to support was missing.

    Any editorial changes on elements from external ontologies are declared in Metadata4Ing by an annotation with skos:editorialNote at item-level.

    To get the original set of statements we encourage to visit the original namespace of the respective item.

    Metadata4Ing reuses elements from the following ontologies:

    - BIBO = Bibliographic Ontology

    - BIRO = Bibliographic Reference Ontology

    - DCAT = Data Catalog

    - DCTERMS = Dublin Core Terms

    - FOAF = Friend of a Friend

  description: A vocabulary, or music ontology, to describe classical music and performances. Classes (categories) for musical works, events, instruments and performers, as well as related properties are defined. Make sure to distinguish musical works (e.g. Opera) from performance events (Opera_Event), or works (String_Quartette) from performer (StringQuartetEnsemble in this vocab), whose natural language terms are used interchangeblly. The present version experiments more precise model to describe a musical work, its representations (performances, scores, etc) and a musical event to present a representation (a concert). Includes 30 keys as individuals.

For the open vocabulary covering various mobility aspects we use RDF (Resource Description Framework) - a recommended specification of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the so-called lingua franca for the integration of data and web. We invite everyone who is interested to join our MobiVoc initiative and to participate in the development of the Open Mobility Vocabulary.

  description: >-
    The NORIA-O project is a data model for IT networks, events and operations
    information.

    The ontology is developed using web technologies (e.g. RDF, OWL, SKOS) and is intended as a structure for realizing an IT Service Management (ITSM) Knowledge Graph (KG) for Anomaly Detection (AD) and Risk Management applications.

    The model has been developed in collaboration with operational teams, and in connection with third parties linked vocabularies.


    Alignment with third parties vocabularies is implemented on a per class or per property basis when relevant (e.g. with `rdfs:subClassOf`, `owl:equivalentClass`).

    Directions for direct instanciation of these vocabularies are provided for cases where implementing a class/property alignment is redundant.

    Alignment holds for the following vocabulary releases:

    - [BBO](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02365012/) 1.0.0

    - [BOT](https://w3id.org/bot/) 0.3.2

    The Ontology for Managing Geometry (OMG) is an ontology for describing
    geometry descriptions of objects. It provides means to support the
    application of multiple geometry descriptions of the same object as well as
    the description of the geometry evolution over time. The OMG is based the
    concepts introduced in the Ontology for Property Management (OPM) ontology.


    This ontology was created within the research project SCOPE, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi).


    The initial version of the ontology (v0.0.1) is documented in:

In addition, the ontology provides the ability to capture various data transformations that occurred before energy estimates may be used with relevant conversion factors. For example, sensors may provide raw readings about a water flow of an irrigation rig in an agri-food operation which is then used as a proxy to estimate the total volume of fertilisers used.

    ## RDF Presentation and RDF Presentation Negotiation


    An RDF graph can be presented in several ways, using different media types. Examples of RDF media types include `application/rdf+xml`, `text/turtle`, `application/json+ld`.


    Today, most of the content consumed/produced/published, on the Web is not presented in RDF.


    In the Web of Things, HTTP servers and clients would rather exchange lightweight documents, potentially binary.

    Currently, most existing RDF Presentations generically apply to any RDF graph, at the cost of being heavy text-based documents.

    Yet, lightweight HTTP servers/clients could be better satisfied with consuming/producing/publishing lightweight documents, may its structure be application-specific.

    The objective of SAREF4EHAW is to extend SAREF ontology for the
    eHealth/Ageing-well (EHAW) vertical. Clause 4.1 of the present document
    shortly introduces a high level view of the envisioned SAREF4EHAW semantic
    model and modular ontology, with the retained concepts (i.e. classes) and
    their relations.

    SAREF4EHAW extension has been specified and formalised by investigating EHAW domain related resources, as reported in ETSI TR 103 509, such as: potential stakeholders, standardization initiatives, alliances/associations, European projects, EC directives, existing ontologies, and data repositories. Therefore, SAREF4EHAW modular ontology shall both:
     - Allow the implementation of a limited set of typical EHAW related use cases already identified in ETSI TR 103 509, i.e.
     - Use case 1 ?elderly at home monitoring and support?,
     - Use case 2 ?monitoring and support of healthy lifestyles for citizens?,
     - Use case 3 ?Early Warning System (EWS) and Cardiovascular Accidents detection?.
     - Fulfil the eHealth Ageing Well related requirements provided in ETSI TR 103 509, mainly the ontological ones that were mostly taken as input for the ontology specification.

    SAREF4EHAW mainly reuses the following existing ontologies: SAREF, ETSI SmartBAN reference model, SAREF 4 Environment extension and W3C SSN System module. The following figure presents the high level view of SAREF4EHAW ontology.

    ![SAREF4SYST overview](diagrams/SAREF4EHAW_Model.jpg)

    For semantic interoperability handling purposes, an ontology based solution, combined with sensing-as-a-service and WoT strategies, is retained for SAREF4EHAW. Therefore, an upper level ontology, at service level, shall also behas been fully modelled (Service class and sub-classes depicted in the previous figure).

    For embedded semantic analytics purposes, SAREF4EHAW shall behas been designed using the modularity principle (see ETSI TR 103 509) and can thus be mainly described by the following self-contained knowledge sub-ontologies (or modules): HealthActor, Ban, HealthDevice, Function (measured data related concepts included) and Service.

  description: SAREF4INMA is an extension of SAREF for the industry and manufacturing domain. SAREF4INMA focuses on extending SAREF for the industry and manufacturing domain to solve the lack of interoperability between various types of production equipment that produce items in a factory and, once outside the factory, between different organizations in the value chain to uniquely track back the produced items to the corresponding production equipment, batches, material and precise time in which they were manufactured. SAREF4INMA is specified and published by ETSI in the TS 103 410-5 associated to this ontology file. SAREF4INMA was created to be aligned with related initiatives in the smart industry and manufacturing domain in terms of modelling and standardization, such as the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI), which combines several standards used by the various national initiatives in Europe that support digitalization in manufacturing. The full list of use cases, standards and requirements that guided the creation of SAREF4INMA are described in the associated ETSI TR 103 507.

    The present document is the technical specification of SAREF4SYST, a generic
    extension of [ETSI TS 103 264
    SAREF](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/103264/02.01.01_60/ts_103264v020101p.pdf)
    that defines an ontology pattern which can be instantiated for different
    domains. SAREF4SYST defines Systems, Connections between systems, and
    Connection Points at which systems may be connected. These core concepts can
    be used generically to define the topology of features of interest, and can
    be specialized for multiple domains. The topology of features of interest is
    highly important in many use cases. If a room holds a lighting device, and
    if it is adjacent with an open window to a room whose luminosity is low,
    then by turning on the lighting device in the former room one may expect
    that the luminosity in the latter room will rise.


    The SAREF4SYST ontology pattern can be instantiated for different domains. For example to describe zones inside a building (systems), that share a frontier (connections). Properties of systems are typically state variables (e.g. agent population, temperature), whereas properties of connections are typically flows (e.g. heat flow).


    SAREF4SYST has two main aims: on the one hand, to extend SAREF with the capability or representing general topology of systems and how they are connected or interact and, on the other hand, to exemplify how ontology patterns may help to ensure an homogeneous structure of the overall SAREF ontology and speed up the development of extensions.


    SAREF4SYST consists both of a core ontology, and guidelines to create ontologies following the SAREF4SYST ontology pattern. The core ontology is a lightweight OWL-DL ontology that defines 3 classes and 9 object properties.


    Use cases for ontology patterns are described extensively in  [ETSI TR 103 549 Clauses 4.2 and 4.3](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103500_103599/103549/01.01.01_60/tr_103549v010101p.pdf).


    For the Smart Energy domain:


    - Electric power systems can exchange electricity with other electric power systems. The electric energy can flow both ways in some cases (from the Public Grid to a Prosumer), or in only one way (from the Public Grid to a Load). Electric power systems can be made up of different sub-systems. Generic sub-types of electric power systems include producers, consumers, storage systems, transmission systems.

    - Electric power systems may be connected one to another through electrical connection points. An Electric power system may have multiple connection points (Multiple Winding Transformer generally have one single primary winding with two or more secondary windings). Generic sub-types of electrical connection points include plugs, sockets, direct-current, single-phase, three-phase, connection points.

    - An Electrical connection may exist between two Electric power systems at two of their respective connection points. Generic sub-types of electrical connections include Single-phase Buses, Three-phase Buses. A single-phase electric power system can be connected using different configurations at a three-phase bus (RN, SN, TN types).


    For the Smart Building domain:


    - Buildings, Storeys, Spaces, are different sub-types of Zones. Zones can contain sub-zones. Zones can be adjacent or intersect with other zones.

    - Two zones may share one or more connections. For example some fresh air may be created inside a storey if it has two controllable openings to the exterior at different cardinal points.


    A graphical overview of the SAREF4SYST ontology is provided in Figure 1. In such figure:


    - Rectangles are used to denote Classes. The label of the rectangle is the identifier of the Class.

    - Plain arrows are used to represent Object Properties between Classes. The label of the arrow is the identifier of the Object Property. The origin of the arrow is the domain Class of the property, and the target of the arrow is the range Class of the property.

    - Dashed arrows with identifiers between stereotype signs (i.e. "`<< >>`") refer to OWL axioms that are applied to some property. Four pairs of properties are inverse one of the other; the property `s4syst:connectedTo` is symmetric, and properties `s4syst:hasSubSystem` and `s4syst:hasSubSystem` are transitive.

    - A symbol =1 near the target of an arrow denotes that the associated property is functional. A symbol ? denotes a local existential restriction.

    It is worth noticing that some concepts are imported from SSN, but not SSN as a whole. This is a design choice intended to separate as much as possible the definition on actuator from the definition of sensor, which are completely different concept that can be used independantly from each other.

    Smart Building Evacuation Ontology (SBEO) is an ontology that couples the
    information about any building with its occupants such that it can be used
    in many useful ways. For example, indoor localization of people, detection
    of any hazard, a recommendation of normal routes such as shopping or stadium
    seating routes, or safe and feasible emergency evacuation routes or both of
    them all together.


    The core SBEO covers the concepts related to the geometry of building, devices and components of the building, route graphs correspondent to the building topology, users' characteristics and preferences, situational awareness of both building (hazard detection, status of routes in terms of availability and occupancy) and users (tracking, management of groups, status in terms of fitness), and emergency evacuation.

  description: During the modeling of software processes, work products are traditionally treated as atomic units, with names but no structure, and they are generated or changed during the course of the projects. In fact, the language SPEM does not offer mechanisms to detail the structure of work products, allowing only identify whether it is an artifact, a deliverable or an outcome of the project. The typical work products in the software processes are often documents or source code and they are managed from specialized or generic tools. For example, software modeling tools such as Rational Rose, or version control systems such as Git are examples of specialized tools that provide support to the management of certain types of work products. However, other generic tools such as content management systems, document management systems and collaborative editing systems or wikis can also be used to manage evidences of the processes. The design of models for certain types of work products has been an approach used in model-driven web methodologies. However, it is common the need for adapting and customizing well-known methodologies for their application in concrete situations and in specific organizations, a.k.a. process tailoring. Therefore, a vocabulary to define flexible work products in terms of structure and type of its artifacts is proposed here.

lov.tempo:
  authority: lov
  description: >-
    In a typical (uni)temporal data model every resource's appearance (and
    disappearance) is being tracked.

    Numerous systems accomplish unitemporal tracking, either externally by e.g. using git to record the insertion or deletion of a resource, or internally by e.g. using prov:generatedAtTime and prov:invalidatedAtTime.

    This axis of time is known as *system time*, and none of TempO's concern because for one there is readily available support, and moreover because unitemporal tracking is used for principally true statements, i.e. those that have always been (considered) true or will always be (considered) true.


    TempO addresses bitemporal and tritemporal setups: Resources which are (known or believed to be) valid and efficacious for some time.

    A second time axis orthogonal to system time is introduced, that is a resource can be valid even though it is currently not in the system, or, conversely, can be already or still invalid by the time it enters the system.


    Efficacy, sometimes called decision time, is yet another concept orthogonal to validity, i.e. a resource that is no longer or not yet valid can be efficacious.

    The converse, a valid but inefficacious resource in the system, is *usually* not encountered but TempO does not impose restrictions on the shape of the time area.


    In general the necessity for tracking both validity and efficacy arises in areas where concepts are assigned a code or label that is subject to reuse following invalidation.

    Tracking efficacy and validity concurrently then allows for fine-grained control over how much future knowledge or how much past knowledge we tolerate in a datset.


    Example:

    --------

    Czechoslovakia was founded in 1918 but became part of Germany, Hungary and Poland in 1938.

    It was reestablished in 1945 but split into two sovereign states in 1993.

    The ISO 3166 country code for Czechoslovakia used to be 'CS', assigned in 1974, published in February 1978, and invalidated with the country's split.

    In 2003 ISO 3166 reassigned the country code 'CS' to Serbia and Montenegro.

    The facts were assembled in 2018 and written down as follows:

        cc:CSHH
            a cc:ISO3166-CountryCode ;
            rdfs:label "CS" ;
            cc:refersTo "Czechoslovakia" ;
            prov:generatedAtTime "2018-02-29T04:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .
            tempo:validFrom "1978-02"^^xsd:gYearMonth ;
            tempo:validTill "1993-01-01"^^xsd:date ;
            tempo:efficaciousFrom "1918"^^xsd:gYear , "1945"^^xsd:gYear ;
            tempo:efficaciousTill "1938"^^xsd:gYear , "2003"^^xsd:gYear .

    The use of the country code 'CS' in a statement from 1988 can be resolved to cc:CSHH, as of today, free from ambiguity; it was valid back then after all and we know that today.

    The same query in 2017 (point-in-time query) would have yielded no results because the information hadn't been in the system back then.

    Point-in-time queries, however, are not TempO's major concern so only as-of-today queries are assumed from now on.


    Following the country's split it is highly likely that news reports from, say, 1994 highlighting the then-recent past would still have used 'CS' to refer to cc:CSHH.

    According to the resource this is possible, a query for 'CS' in 1994 would bring up cc:CSHH as it is efficacious but marked as invalidated.


    On the other end of history, the use of the code 'CS' in, say, 1976 is plausible.  The code was decided on but not yet formally published.

    A query for 'CS' as used in 1976 would bring up cc:CSHH, marked as anachronistic.

    Going back further, a statement from, say 1942, using the code 'CS' must clearly refer to something else.

    A query for 'CS' as used in 1976 would yield not yield any results.

    The goal of TempO is to allow for temporal constraints with control over how much future or past is permissible directly on the published resource, and as such, TempO does not restrict domain/ranges.

  authority: lov
  description: >-
    This ontology, called VIR, is an extension of CIDOC-CRM created to sustain
    propositions on the nature of visual elements and permit these descriptions
    to be published on the Web.

    With the term visual element, we refer to those signs identified in the visual space as distinct and documentable units, and subject to an analytical interpretation.

    The scope of this ontology is to s to provide a framework to support the identification, annotation and interconnections between diverse visual elements and presents and assist their documentation and retrieval. Specifically, the model aims to clarify the identity and the relation of these visual signs, providing the necessary classes to characterise their constituent elements, reference, symbolic content and source of interpretation.

    VIR expands on key entities and properties from CIDOC-CRM, introducing new classes and relationships responding to the visual and art historical community, specifically building up on the iconographical tradition. The result is a model which differentiates between interpretation and element identified, providing a clear distinction between denotation and signification of an element. As a consequence of such distinction, the ontology allows for the definition of diverse denotative criteria for the same representation, which could change based on traditions and perspective. Visual objects can be, in fact, polysemic and ambiguous, and it is not so easy to pin down a denotative or connotative meaning because they are very much context-dependent.
