  metric_number: 1
  metric_short_name: Unique Identifier Metadata and Data
  metric_name: Metadata and data are assigned a globally unique identifier.
  description: A globally unique identifier may be assigned to a landing page containing metadata, a metadata file or a data file such that it can be referenced unambiguously by humans or machines. Globally unique means an identifier should be associated with only one resource at any time. Examples of unique identifiers are Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI), Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) such as URL and URN, Digital Object Identifier (DOI), the Handle System, identifiers.org, w3id.org and Archival Resource Key (ARK). A data repository may assign a globally unique identifier to your metadata when you publish and make it available through their services.
  fair_principle: F1
  target: Metadata and Data
  evaluation_mechanism: Identifier is considered unique if it is successfully validated using syntax or scheme for URI, URN, UUID or HASH like identifiers or persistent identifiers.

  metric_number: 2
  metric_short_name: Persistent Identifier Metadata and Data
  metric_name: Metadata and data are assigned a persistent identifier.
  description: Both, metadata as well as data should be provided with a persistent identifier. We make a distinction between the uniqueness and persistence of an identifier. An HTTP URL (the address of a given unique resource on the web) is globally unique, but may not be persistent as the URL of data may be not accessible (link rot problem) or the data available under the original URL may be changed (content drift problem). Identifiers based on the Handle System, DOI, ARK are both globally unique and persistent. They are maintained and governed such that they remain stable and resolvable for the long term. The persistent identifier (PID) may be resolved (point) to a landing page, metadata or the data content (downloadable artefact), or none if the data or repository is no longer maintained. Therefore, ensuring persistence is a shared responsibility between a PID service provider (e.g., datacite) and its clients (e.g., data repositories). For example, the DOI system guarantees the persistence of its identifiers through its social (e.g., policy) and technical infrastructures, whereas a data provider ensures the availability of the resource (e.g., landing page, downloadable artefact) associated with the identifier.
  fair_principle: F1
  target: Metadata and Data
  evaluation_mechanism: A persistent identifier is considered to be valid if the given identifier complies with a valid PID synthax. To be valid, the PID further has to be registered or maintained by a PID authority which is verified in case a PID is redirected by the PID system regardless of whether this redirection is successful.(see also A1).

- metric_identifier: FsF-F2-01M
  metric_number: 5
  metric_short_name: Descriptive Core Metadata
  metric_name: Metadata includes descriptive core elements (creator, title, data identifier, publisher, publication date, summary and keywords) to support data findability.
  description: Metadata is descriptive information about a data object. Since the metadata required differs depending on the users and their applications, this metric focuses on core metadata. The core metadata is the minimum descriptive information required to enable data finding, including citation which makes it easier to find data. We determine the required metadata based on common data citation guidelines (e.g., DataCite, ESIP, and IASSIST), and metadata recommendations for data discovery (e.g., EOSC Datasets Minimum Information (EDMI), DataCite Metadata Schema, W3C Recommendation Data on the Web Best Practices and Data Catalog Vocabulary). This metric focuses on domain-agnostic core metadata. Domain or discipline-specific metadata specifications are covered under metric FsF-R1.3-01M. A repository should adopt a schema that includes properties of core metadata, whereas data authors should take the responsibility of providing core metadata.
  fair_principle: F2
  target: Metadata
  evaluation_mechanism: Metadata can be offered in different ways. here we focus on common web based strategies. These include 1) embedding metadata within the landing page such as JSON-LD, OpenGraph, Microdata, Dublin Core, 2) offering typed links which lead to metadata within the HTML code of the metadata or signposting links. 3) enable content negotiation and deliver e.g. RDF, JSON-LD or XML on demand. The metric evaluates the completeness of metadata in case metadata has been retrieved.

  metric_short_name: Searchable Metadata
  metric_name: Metadata is offered in such a way that it can be registered or indexed by search engines.
  description: Metadata can be available via multiple endpoints. For example, a repository may distribute its metadata via a metadata protocol (e.g. via OAI-PMH) and/or a custom web service, but these may only support certain catalogs. This metric focuses on those methods of making metadata available that are beneficial to as many user groups as possible, i.e. that can be consumed by well-known, large catalogs and search engines such as Google and Bing.  Such metadata should be offered according to the requirements of these search engines.
  target: Metadata
  evaluation_mechanism: The metric is evaluated using the given metadata encodings as well as standards known to support major search engines such as Dublin Core or schema.org or DCAT encoded in microdata, RDFa, embedded JSON-LD or meta tags according to the webmaster guidelines published by e.g. Google or Bing.

  metric_short_name: Data Access Information
  metric_name: Metadata contains access level and access conditions of the data.
  description: This metric determines if the metadata includes the level of access to the data such as public, embargoed, restricted, or metadata-only access and its access conditions. Both access level and conditions are necessary information to potentially gain access to the data. It is recommended that data should be as open as possible and as closed as necessary. Datasets should be released into the public domain and openly accessible without restrictions when possible. Embargoed access refers to data that will be made publicly accessible at a specific date which should be specified in the metadata. Restricted access refers to data that can be accessed under certain conditions or is available to a particular group of users or after permission is granted.

  description: A metadata document or selected parts of the document may incorporate additional terms from semantic resources (also referred as semantic artefacts) so that the contents are unambiguous and can be processed automatically by machines. This enrichment facilitates enhanced data search and interoperability of data from different sources. Ontology, thesaurus, and taxonomy are kinds of semantic resources, and they come with varying degrees of expressiveness and computational complexity. Knowledge organization schemes such as thesaurus and taxonomy are semantically less formal than ontologies.

  metric_short_name: Qualified references to related entities
  metric_name: Metadata includes qualified references between the data and its related entities.
  description: Linking data to its related entities will increase its potential for reuse. The linking information should be captured as part of the metadata. A dataset may be linked to its prior version, related datasets or resources (e.g. publication, physical sample, funder, repository, platform, site, or observing network registries). Links between data and its related entities should be qualified, thus expressed through relation types (e.g., DataCite Metadata Schema specifies relation types between research objects through the fields ‘RelatedIdentifier’ and ‘RelationType’), and preferably use persistent Identifiers for related entities.

  description: This metric evaluates if a description (properties) of the content of the data is specified in the metadata. The description should be an accurate reflection of  the actual data deposited. Data content descriptors include but are not limited to resource type (e.g., data or a collection of data), variable(s) measured or observed, data format and size or data service and protocol. Ideally, ontological vocabularies should be used to describe data content to support interdisciplinary reuse.

  metric_short_name: Data Usage License
  metric_name: Metadata includes license information under which data can be reused.
  description: This metric evaluates if data is associated with a license because otherwise users cannot reuse it in a clear legal context. We encourage the application of licenses for all kinds of data whether public, restricted or for specific users. Without an explicit license, users do not have a clear idea of what can be done with your data. Licenses can be of standard type (Creative Commons, Open Data Commons Open Database License) or bespoke licenses, and rights statements which indicate the conditions under which data can be reused. It is highly recommended to use a standard, machine-readable license such that it can be interpreted by machines and humans. In order to inform users about what rights they have to use a dataset, the license information should be specified as part of the dataset’s metadata.

  metric_short_name: Data Provenance
  metric_name: Metadata includes provenance information about data creation or generation.
  description: >-
    Data provenance (also known as lineage) represents a dataset’s history, including the people, entities, and processes involved in its creation, management and longer-term curation.
    It is essential to provide provenance information about your data to provide valuable context and to enable informed use and reuse.
    The levels of provenance information needed can vary depending on the data type (e.g., measurement, observation, derived data, or data product) and research domains.
    For that reason, it is difficult to define a set of finite provenance properties that will be adequate for all domains.
    Based on existing work, we suggest that the following provenance properties of data generation or collection are included in the metadata record as a minimum.
    (a) Sources of data, e.g., datasets and other resources the data is derived from
    (b) Data creation or collection date
    (c) Contributors involved in data creation and their roles
    (d) Data publication, modification and versioning information
    There are various ways through which provenance information may be included in a metadata record.
    Provenance information can be given in a linked provenance record expressed explicitly in e.g., PROV-O or PAV or Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID).
    Alternatively suitable metadata properties can be used. For example, Dublin Core has been mapped to PROV in PROV-DC which allows further mappings of other metadata standards to PROV.
  fair_principle: R1.2
  target: Metadata
  evaluation_mechanism: Metrics are assessed using provenance related information contained in metadata which can either be specific elements which can be mapped e.g. to PROV-O or the use of provenance related namespaces and associated terms.

  metric_short_name: Community-Endorsed Metadata Standard
  metric_name: Metadata follows a standard recommended by the target research community of the data.
  description: In addition to core metadata required to support data discovery (covered under metric FsF-F2-01M), metadata to support data reusability should be made available following community-endorsed metadata standards. Some communities have well-established metadata standards (e.g., geospatial [ISO19115], biodiversity [DarwinCore, ABCD, EML], social science [DDI], astronomy [International Virtual Observatory Alliance Technical Specifications]) while others have limited standards or standards that are under development (e.g., engineering and linguistics). The use of community-endorsed metadata standards is usually encouraged and supported by domain and discipline-specific repositories.

  metric_short_name: Data File format
  metric_name: Data is available in a file format recommended by the target research community.
  description: >-
    File formats refer to methods for encoding digital information. For example, CSV for tabular data, NetCDF for multidimensional data and GeoTIFF for raster imagery. Data should be made available in a file format that is backed by the research community to enable data sharing and reuse. Consider for example, file formats that are widely used and supported by the most commonly used software and tools. These formats also should be suitable for long-term storage and archiving, which are usually recommended by a data repository. The formats not only give a higher certainty that your data can be read in the future, but they will also help to increase the reusability and interoperability. Using community-endorsed formats enables data to be loaded directly into the software and tools used for data analysis. It makes it possible to easily integrate your data with other data using the same preferred format. The use of preferred formats will also help to transform the format to a newer one, in case a preferred format gets outdated.
