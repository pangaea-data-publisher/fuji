  metric_number: 1
  metric_short_name: Software Identifier
  metric_name: Does the software have a globally unique and persistent identifier?
  description: A software object may be assigned with a globally unique identifier such that it can be referenced unambiguously by humans or machines. Globally unique means an identifier should be associated with only one resource at any time.
  fair_principle: F1
  target: Software
  evaluation_mechanism: Check that an established identifier scheme from the CESSDA Software Publication polices is used to identify software.
  test_scoring_mechanism: cumulative
  metric_tests:

- metric_identifier: FRSM-02-F1.1-CESSDA
  metric_number: 2
  metric_short_name: Software Component Identifiers
  metric_name: Can different components of the software be individually identified?
  description: Conceptually, it is useful for identifiers to be assigned at a more granular level than just the software project (often synonymous with the “software concept” or “software project”). For instance a software product may consist of different modules, which in turn may be implemented by different files. This metric tests that these different components are not all assigned the same identifier, and that the relationship between components is embodied in the identifier metadata.
  fair_principle: F1.1
  target: Software
  evaluation_mechanism: Check that each software product is split into component microservices, each with its own DOI.
  test_scoring_mechanism: cumulative
  metric_tests:
