  metric_number: 1
  metric_short_name: Software Identifier
  metric_name: Does the software have a globally unique and persistent identifier?
  description: A software object may be assigned with a globally unique identifier such that it can be referenced unambiguously by humans or machines. Globally unique means an identifier should be associated with only one resource at any time.
  fair_principle: F1
  target: Software
  evaluation_mechanism: Check if the software identifier is based on a suitable identifier scheme, and test it can be resolved.
  test_scoring_mechanism: cumulative
  metric_tests:

  metric_short_name: Software Component Identifiers
  metric_name: Do the different components of the software have their own identifiers?
  description: Conceptually, it is useful for identifiers to be assigned at a more granular level than just the software project (often synonymous with the “software concept” or “software project”). For instance a software product may consist of different modules, which in turn may be implemented by different files. This metric tests that these different components are not all assigned the same identifier, and that the relationship between components is embodied in the identifier metadata.
